FOVoffset makes use of the Action Camera CVars to dissociate your character's head from the screen's center.

Since most of the action takes place in the upper-half of the screen, this is especially useful to raise the camera, and thus, recenter the action.

FOVoffset also hides the warning pop-up associated with enabling experimental CVars

For a more advanced use of the Action Camera CVars, you can download [AdvancedInterfaceOptions][1], head to the CVar browser and search for "test_camera".
